let’s bake some bread!

React + TypeScript + Vite + Bun

lots of shadcn components especially Emil’s Vaul drawer component

`bun run dev --host` to run dev server locally
`bun run build` to build (this is what Netlify is doing) and `bun run preview` to check it out

“Damn he’s on bun his build times are fast damn” — liamp.uk
